An example that creates a 3D texture on openGL and loads it with a LUT (lookup table), for fast color correction, grading, et cetera.
It was done using references/examples from [Game Programming Wiki](http://content.gpwiki.org/index.php/OpenGL:Tutorials:3D_Textures) and [GPU Gems 2](http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter24.html).  
If you have something to add or correct, please do!
